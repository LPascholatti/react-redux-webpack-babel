# React/Webpack/Babel/Redux Boilerplate

## Boilerplate that replaces 'create-react-app' by setting up Webpack, React and Babel. This boilerplate also includes a Redux configuration.

1. Clone this repository and run:

```npm install```

2. Now you are ready to code, start your development server by running:

```npm start```

Note: Your reducers folder do not contain any reducer, therefore your './reducers/index.js' file does not contain any reducers in its combineReducers object.
